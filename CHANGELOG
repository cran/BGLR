version 1.0 (2012-10-01)
  
  It starts as a copy of BLR version 1.3
  
  major changes, new list interface, models added for continuous, discrete and 
  censored traits. 
  
  For continuous traits:
  
  -BayesA
  -BayesB
  -BayesC-pi
  -RKHS(reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces)
  
  For discrete traits
  
  -Binary responses
  -Ordinal responses

   New functions to read and write plink files in binary format

version 1.0.1 

  initial release

version 1.0.2

  some documentation fixes, some comments added to the code

version 1.0.3
  some methods added: summary, residuals, predict, effects

version 1.0.4
  methods added to deal with heterogeneous variances
  bug fixes for BayesB and BayesC-pi. There was a bug that included 
  markers that should not appear in the model
