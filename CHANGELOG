version 1.0 (2012-10-01)
  
  It starts as a copy of BLR version 1.3
  
  Major changes, new list interface, models added for continuous, discrete and 
  censored traits 
  
  For continuous traits:
  
  -BayesA
  -BayesB
  -BayesC-pi
  -RKHS(reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces)
  
  For discrete traits
  
  -Binary responses
  -Ordinal responses

   New functions to read and write plink files in binary format

version 1.0.1 

  Initial release

version 1.0.2

  Some documentation fixes, some comments added to the code

version 1.0.3
  
  Some methods added: summary, residuals, predict, effects

version 1.0.4
  
  Methods added to deal with heterogeneous variances
  
  Bug fixes for BayesB and BayesC-pi. There was a bug that included 
  markers that should not appear in the model

version 1.0.5
  
  Using BRR_sets (BRR_windows removed)
  
  Saving effects in binary files & computing windows

version 1.0.6
  
  Never released, problems with reverse depencies

version 1.0.7
  
  Removing OpenMP Flags, C code for registring routines added
  
  Update urls

version 1.0.8
  
  Bayesian Ridge Regression now supports (square) triangular matrices and samples effects efficiently
  
  Sampling from truncated normal distribution is performed using the truncnorm library
  
  Fixes in C code for avoiding integer overflow in sampling functions with large datasets
  
  CITATION added
  
  Several fixes for displaying messages when using stop(), cat(), etc.

version 1.0.9
  
  Saving effects in binary files now supports two storage modes: 8 bits (double, default) and 4 bits (single).
  
  Added several functions, i)BLRCross and ii)BLRXy which implements efficient fitting of models based on summary 
  statistics X'X and X'y, which is faster when number of individuals (n) is bigger than the number of markers(p).
  
  Added functions to fit multitrait models with arbitrary number of random effects.  

version 1.1.0
  Added Biochemistry information in data.frame mice.pheno.

  Added genetic map for mice dataset.

  Added support for saving fixed effects.

  Added new routines to speed up computations in Multitrait models.

version 1.1.1
  Small bug fix when printing error information from dgesv routine in file sampler_multitrait.c
